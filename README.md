Hi, I’m Reza. studied biomedical engineering, focusing on bioelectronics, signal processing, and telemedicine. I’ve worked in the IT sector for several years. 
I enjoy embedded systems, RTOS, bioinstrumentation, general programming, and electronic circuit design in my free time. I have hands-on experience in electronic design, embedded systems, backend, and frontend development. For me, tools are just tools—the goal always comes first.
